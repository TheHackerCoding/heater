# `heater` - things that I created to mess up your CPU, RAM, and storage

## File map

```
src/ - files
    -/js - the source files for the Javascript part
    -/cpp - the source files for the C++ part
make.py - the holy file to compile everything (which isn't being used)
Makefile - the compiler for everything (that's actually being used)

## DISCLAMER

I'm not responsible for any damage you could cause using _heater_. Ultimately, there might be legal ramifications to doing any of this depending upon where you live, so you should check your local relevant legislation. Explicitly you might be acting illicitly by recording information without first informing the user interfacing with the organization, adequately allowing them a chance to stop the event that they aren't content with. I'm not experienced enough in its legalities to offer you appropriate guidance in that regard however. If you are doubtful, I recommend you don't do it.

I insist, **DO NOT** use this program for any illegal or harmful
purpose. Use it under your own risk and responsibilty.

## Purpose

The only purpose I made this was for people to mess around with their friends with their computer just to ramp up their cpu and mess up their storage. This could also be used to mess up scammers' computers for those people who do that. If you do that, just please give me some credit. :D

## Extra info

This has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 (specifically [BackBox Linux 7](https://www.backbox.org/) if it matters) but should run on any os (Linux, Windows, and MacOS) if you have make, node, and gcc

## Compile

`make` _the name of the file_
